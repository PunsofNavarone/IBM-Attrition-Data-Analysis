Each R file is a 'markdown file' and has the extension Rmd.

While running each file, please replace the input path for the source file.

Currently each Rmd file points to local instances stored on the desktop.



So to ensure the file runs succesfully, for example, you will replace the path with your own local/C drive path.



Apart from this, we have used some external libraries which may need to be downloaded before running.

A comprehensive list of libraries used can be found in the first chunk of LogRegression_MissingData.Rmd
